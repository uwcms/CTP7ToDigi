CTP7ToDigi is a EDProducer which 
  (1) uses CTP7Client to get spy data from its buffers 
  (2) uses RCTInfo to decode the raw uint32_t words
  (3) builds L1CaloRegions and L1CaloEmCands
  (4) puts those two collestions in to the event

This is a kludge to build -- I copied the relevant classes to the
CMSSW area as I can't compile and link using the online SVN repo.
If any of those change online, we should change them here too.

The configuration script for cmsRun is:

test/CTP7ToDigi_cfg.py 

This python script reads 170 events from the CTP7Client, the maximum
that can be accommodated in the BRAMs.  It saves the data in the
CMSSW formatted file.  It is the users job to ensure that there
is legitimate data in the CTP7 memory before using this program.

To run:

cmsRun CTP7ToDigi_cfg.py

In order to succeed, you should have a CTP7Server accessible on the
TCP/IP network.  

To try things out, you can use CTP7Play/ctp7Server on a linux box to 
emulate a real CTP7.
